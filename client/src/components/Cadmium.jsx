        <p>
          Cadmium accumulates in our bodies and throughout the environment. It
          is industrially used in pigments, as a coating for steel and copper,
          as an additive in plastics, in batteries and in solar panels. Exposure
          to Cadmium can cause sever respiratory, liver and kidney problems,
          which may be irreversible and fatal. Skeletal symptoms may include
          bone softening and loss of mineral density resulting in increased risk
          of fractures.

          Cadmium testing is made easy by simply filling Home-Health-Chemistry's
          test tubes in a water-based solution and comparing the color change to
          the provided reference card. Four simple step is all it takes to carry
          out this high-quality test as shown below. The test tubes contain the
          exact amount of indicator required for easy and safe handling.
